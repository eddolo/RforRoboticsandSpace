**Title:** Resetability on SO(3): A Two-Pass Scaled Replay Primitive for Fast Attitude Recovery in Robots and Spacecraft

**Authors:** (Your team here)

**Abstract**  
We introduce a reset primitive on SO(3) that cancels recent orientation changes by **scaling** a short history of small rotations by \(\lambda=\pi/\theta_{\text{net}}\) and **replaying it twice** in the same order. We define **resetability** \(R=1-|w(q_{\text{reset}})|\) (with \(q_{\text{reset}}\) the two-pass composition) as an operational proxy for sequence commutativity. On synthetic and control-in-the-loop simulations, **low-R** windows (\(<0.05\)) show near-perfect attitude reset with reduced time-to-threshold versus baseline controllers. We demonstrate applicability to humanoid balance (IMU + whole-body control) and spacecraft attitude recovery (reaction wheels / RCS). A reference library (C++/Python), ROS2 nodes, and evaluation suite are provided.

**1. Introduction**  
Short-horizon orientation errors arise from disturbances, bias, and controller scheduling. Traditional recovery relies on eigen-axis slews or feedback alone. We propose a complementary **feed-forward reset**: learn from the **actual** recent rotation history and cancel it by scaled **two-pass replay**. This exploits near-commutativity of small orientation increments common in low-dynamic-pressure phases (spacecraft vacuum/coast, terminal landing burn; torso stabilization in robots).

**2. Background**  
Rotations compose non-commutatively. For small increments, the Baker‚ÄìCampbell‚ÄìHausdorff (BCH) expansion shows higher-order commutators scale with angle products. When axes are nearly aligned, commutators are small: a single scale \(\lambda=\pi/\theta_{\text{net}}\) applied to the sequence and replayed twice cancels first-order net rotation; residuals are dominated by commutators.

**3. Method**  
Let motion history be \(\{(\hat n_k,\theta_k)\}_{k=1}^N\). Define net: \(q_{\text{net}}=\prod_k \exp(\theta_k \hat n_k)\), \(\theta_{\text{net}}\) from its axis‚Äìangle. Choose \(\lambda=\pi/\theta_{\text{net}}\) (clamped). The reset composition is
\[
q_{\text{reset}}=\Big(\prod_k \exp(\lambda \theta_k \hat n_k)\Big)\Big(\prod_k \exp(\lambda \theta_k \hat n_k)\Big).
\]
We score **resetability**
\[
R = 1 - \big|w(q_{\text{reset}})\big|,
\]
treating \(q\) and \(-q\) identically. Low \(R\) indicates small commutator residuals and high likelihood of success.

**4. Controllers**  
Robotics: in a 500 Hz loop, build a 0.2 s sliding window of IMU-derived axis‚Äìangle steps; if \(R<R_{\text{th}}\) and \(\theta_{\text{net}}>\theta_\epsilon\), inject a jerk-limited **two-pass** orientation primitive blended into whole-body control (torso pitch/roll projection optional).  
Spacecraft: accumulate quaternion diffs at 5‚Äì10 Hz (gyro aiding). For low \(R\), schedule two passes of scaled wheel torques or ŒîV pulses along the same sequence order; enforce min-impulse bit and keep-out cones. For high \(R\), fall back to eigen-axis slew.

**5. Safety & Limits**  
Clamp \(\lambda\in[\lambda_{\min},\lambda_{\max}]\), split large steps, predict feasibility (actuators, keep-outs). Disable in high-aero phases (grid-fin regime). Watchdogs abort on tracking/momentum envelopes.

**6. Experiments**  
**6.1 Kinematic Monte-Carlo.** We generate random sequences with varying axis alignment. Low \(R\) yields residual angles \(<0.2^{\circ}\) (median), while high \(R\) degrades predictably.  
**6.2 Spacecraft ODE.** A rigid-body ADCS model with disturbances demonstrates reduced **time-to-‚â§1¬∞** and lower residuals when \(R<0.1\).  
**6.3 Booster terminal phase.** An attitude-only terminal-phase model shows faster settling when the shim activates; in high-\(R\) segments the shim remains off.

**7. Results**  
Across runs binned by \(R\):  
- **Low** (\(<0.05\)) ‚Äî strong improvement (median residual ‚Üì and time-to-threshold ‚Üì).  
- **Mid** (\(0.05‚Äì0.20\)) ‚Äî moderate benefit; clamps maintain stability.  
- **High** (\(>0.20\)) ‚Äî shim usually disabled; baseline performance retained.

**8. Discussion**  
The two-pass reset is **model-agnostic** and **frame-aware**. It complements feedback by canceling the **history** that created the deviation. Its success hinges on the **commutativity** of the recent motion (captured by \(R\)) and phase conditions (e.g., low dynamic pressure). It does not replace guidance, nor should it be used in rapidly varying aero fields.

**9. Operational Impact**  
Spacecraft/upper stage: expected **5‚Äì15%** reduction in trim ŒîV/propellant in low-\(R\) rich operations; upside up to ~20% depending on disturbance character. Booster terminal phase: sub-percent propellant change but meaningful **settle-time** and **actuator margin** improvements.

**10. Reproducibility**  
We release C++/Python code, ROS2 stubs, and Monte-Carlo scripts. All figures can be regenerated from a clean clone.
